Goal
  1. Find a 21 joints in 2D RGB-image
  2. not only 2D joints coordinates, but also 3D joints
  3. Futermore, wrist-attached camera view but general camera view


Data
  1. Train-image: about 800K 2D virtual RGB images (can increase images as many as we want)
  2. Test-image: any open hand dataset
    - FreiHAND (2019 ICCV)
      => first-large scale hand dataset / 130K images / Adobe Research
    - InterHAND (2020 ECCV)
      => first-interaction hand dataset / 2.6M images / Facebook Research
    - HIU-DMTL (2021 ICCV)
      => annoated all images manually / 40K images
    - Coco
      => low-resolution hand images
    - CMU Panoptic
      => Carnegie Mellon Univ.
      => but, low-resolution hand images
